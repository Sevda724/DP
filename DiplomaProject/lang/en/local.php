    'Almaty Province is famous for its picturesque places and one of them is the charming lake of incredible beauty - Kaindy. It is located within Kolsay Kolderi National Park. Its name means “abundant in birch trees”, despite the fact that birch groves are located a few kilometers away from Kaindy. The lake is surrounded by spruce trees. The trunks of ancient submerged spruce trees rise above the water surface: they were flooded when the lake was formed. The most interesting thing is that the lower branches are surprisingly well preserved, hidden from the sun and wind by cold mountain water. Despite the humid and hot climate of the Almaty Province, the weather is cool near Kaindy Lake even in summer. Be sure to wear warm clothes and comfortable shoes. "This picture\'s worth a thousand words" - this is how we can describe Kaindy Lake. Visit this incredible place and see it with your own eyes.' => 'Almaty Province is famous for its picturesque places and one of them is the charming lake of incredible beauty - Kaindy.

    'Lake Zaysan is undoubtedly one of the oldest bodies of water on the planet. Its exact age is so difficult to determine. According to some indirect signs, scientists suggest that the reservoir was formed at the end of the Cretaceous period, more than 65 million years ago, and therefore dinosaurs graced its waters. If this hypothesis is correct, then the Zaysan may be even older than Lake Baikal, whose age, according to the common opinion, is about 25 million years.' => 'Lake Zaysan is undoubtedly one of the oldest bodies of water on the planet.
