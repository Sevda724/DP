I would clarify: the struggle with yourself - with your greed, love of idleness, inability or fear to put the people on whom you are dependent in place when they try to make you a puppet. If you achieve victory, others will respect you. I walked to my heights in multi-colored “collective farm” boots, in which I arrived in Alma-Ata. I was a student candidate for a long time, I was expelled from the institute, they didn’t take me to the theater ... But now I don’t have “shortness of breath”. What I have now is the result, if you like, compensation for those difficult years. I remember Mikhail Ulyanov - for me he is an ideal person and actor. Ulyanov came from Omsk in tarpaulin boots to enter the Shchukin Theater School. With his work, his desperation, his rigidity and violent temperament, this Russian peasant “teared” everyone in his path and became a great actor. And I am a Kazakh from the earth.

"563","Documental films","Thread","N. Saduova. 2018","The film will be about the life and life of the Tatar people of Kazakhstan through applied art. Tatars in the environment of diversity of cultures have not lost their cultural identity and their traditions. Despite the fact that they were resettled in Kazakhstan after the war period, they managed not to dissolve and maintain their cell of society. This paradox was facilitated by the similarity of cultures with the Kazakh people. In our film, we will tell a story about a woman seamstress - Vadiga Ziyatdinovna, who is engaged in sewing a national Tatar costume. She sews from headwear to pants. The film is about her desire and great perseverance, which helped her in this difficult path. We want to show that the Turkic peoples in Kazakhstan live in unity. The Kazakh and Tatar peoples have a very close cultural and historical connection. Previously, Kazakhs and Tatars were one people, who were connected by a Turkic community. Kazakhs and Tatars living on the territory of Kazakhstan are united by a common origin of the main ethnic components, many elements of material, spiritual and social culture, common, often intersecting in time and space, historical destinies. All peoples inhabiting the country are equal, they all have the full right to study their language and national culture. It is easier for them to live in our country, since our peoples have the same cultural values. Our peoples must be in great unity, because the designation of the word Turk is the unity. The most important thing is that we will unite our peoples through applied art, passing through the generation.","https://static.tildacdn.com/stor3162-6132-4661-b938-363163383166/99608048.png","2018","N.

"564","Documental films","Chuvash","D.Manabay. 2018","“Give us, God, something to feed the hungry and warm the cold to those who come” - these words from the ancient Chuvash prayer, which run like a refrain through many ancient Turkic scriptures, are pronounced by the scientist in the film, as the true credo of the Turkic peoples. At the same time, the film tells the story of Maria Simulina, one of the representatives of the Pavlodar diaspora of the Chuvash, who, while still a young girl, along with her husband accidentally ended up in Kazakhstan, stayed here to live, now forever. The biography of the main character is perhaps not so outstanding as to dedicate newspaper articles or TV news reports to her, but for the viewer, Maria is the most valuable representative of a small, almost disappearing people who, in spite of everything, are trying to preserve their Chuvash culture and language. Elements of everyday life in Maria's house, whether it is a national headdress made by one's own hands, or carefully embroidered paintings with landscapes of her native village, remind the viewer of the roots of the heroine. And all this is a clear confirmation of the words that a person always “carries” his homeland with him. Maria lives by simple things: growing vegetables and fruits in her own garden, not because she is in need, but because her ancestors have been farming for centuries and Maria simply cannot do otherwise, it is inherent in her at the genetic level; trips to the Chuvash cultural center in the city of Pavlodar, where she met quite a few of her countrymen. Together they spend the days of Chuvash culture, touring cities and villages, with their Sespel ensemble, introducing people to Chuvash folk songs. Gathering at Maria's house, they have lively conversations, they say with sadness that the younger generation is no longer eager to learn and speak their native language. They say that Kazakhstan has become a second homeland for them and they will not leave here anywhere. But they all sincerely hope that their grandchildren, having become mature people, will still be drawn to their roots. Man is what he carries within himself. For the viewer, the question remains whether these representatives of the outgoing generation of Pavlodar Chuvashs will be able to pass on to their descendants the national cultural code that is embedded in them.
